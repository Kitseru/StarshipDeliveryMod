Other Infos :
- Sharing the profile code with Thunderstore will also copy the ShipPositionConfig.json file which contains the position changes you made. Otherwise you can also share this file by hand if you don't use Thunderstore. It need to be in the BepInEx config folder in order to work.
- It is recommended that the mod be installed by the entire team, in order to avoid position desynchronization. However, if you're okay with this, the game should still work if some have the mod and some don't.
- It's my first mod, if you see any problems don't hesitate to open a issue !
