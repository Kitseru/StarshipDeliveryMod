---
 Features :

 ---
Details :
 - Purchased items can be found inside a door on the bottom of the ship
 - When Starship enter atmosphere, a sonic bang can be heard everywhere in the map (can be disabled in config)
 - The Dropship music is have various distortion effects (can be disabled in config)
 - Because of the difference of size, I had to change the landing position on each map, it can be modified in a Config file inside the mod folder

Other Infos :
- It is recommended that the mod be installed by the entire team, in order to avoid position desynchronization. However, if you're okay with this, the game should still work if some have the mod and some don't.
- It's my first mod, if you see any problems don't hesitate to open a issue !
